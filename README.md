# Data-Validation 

Summarizing again below the work and objectives:

•	As the Data Validation representative for DGS, we are compiling all data validation and data source information for each of the Key Performance Indicatiors for our divisions.  We are also collecting information on how those measures are developed/built. To do so, we will keep track of calculations used on the data to develop each measure.

• The GitHub repository will serve as a single location that is easily accessible and maintable for members across the organization. The repository will hold all division data for data validation.	

•	Data will be updated and tracked on a regular basis, giving users the opportunity to access historical data (actual and projected). This repository will hold data validation information for this fiscal year, as well as raw data on each KPI moving forward.
